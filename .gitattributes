# Define text-based files that should not have text auto-normalization (e.g., specific data files)
# For example, if you had a specific data file that must maintain exact line endings
# data/*.dat -text

# Enable diff for specific binary file types if supported by Git
# Example for Jupyter notebooks (requires an additional Git configuration)
# *.ipynb diff=ipynb
